    "summary": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a disease that impairs knee function and causes\npain. A radiologist reviews knee X-ray images and grades the severity level of\nthe impairments according to the Kellgren and Lawrence grading scheme; a\nfive-point ordinal scale (0--4). In this study, we used Elastic Net (EN) and\nRandom Forests (RF) to build predictive models using patient assessment data\n(i.e. signs and symptoms of both knees and medication use) and a convolution\nneural network (CNN) trained using X-ray images only. Linear mixed effect\nmodels (LMM) were used to model the within subject correlation between the two\nknees. The root mean squared error for the CNN, EN, and RF models was 0.77,\n0.97, and 0.94 respectively. The LMM shows similar overall prediction accuracy\nas the EN regression but correctly accounted for the hierarchical structure of\nthe data resulting in more reliable inference. Useful explanatory variables\nwere identified that could be used for patient monitoring before X-ray imaging.\nOur analyses suggest that the models trained for predicting the KOA severity\nlevels achieve comparable results when modeling X-ray images and patient data.\nThe subjectivity in the KL grade is still a primary concern.",
