    "summary": "Decision support systems play an important role in medical fields as they can\naugment clinicians to deal more efficiently and effectively with complex\ndecision-making processes. In the diagnosis of headache disorders, however,\nexisting approaches and tools are still not optimal. On the one hand, to\nsupport the diagnosis of this complex and vast spectrum of disorders, the\nInternational Headache Society released in 1988 the International\nClassification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), now in its 3rd edition: a 200\npages document classifying more than 300 different kinds of headaches, where\neach is identified via a collection of specific nontrivial diagnostic criteria.\nOn the other hand, the high number of headache disorders and their complex\ncriteria make the medical history process inaccurate and not exhaustive both\nfor clinicians and existing automatic tools. To fill this gap, we present\nHEAD-ASP, a novel decision support system for the diagnosis of headache\ndisorders. Through a REST Web Service, HEAD-ASP implements a dynamic\nquestionnaire that complies with ICHD-3 by exploiting two logical modules to\nreach a complete diagnosis while trying to minimize the total number of\nquestions being posed to patients. Finally, HEAD-ASP is freely available\non-line and it is receiving very positive feedback from the group of\nneurologists that is testing it.",

    "summary": "Objective: Mining the data contained within Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\ncan potentially generate a greater understanding of medication effects in the\nreal world, complementing what we know from Randomised control trials (RCTs).\nWe Propose a text mining approach to detect adverse events and medication\nepisodes from the clinical text to enhance our understanding of adverse effects\nrelated to Clozapine, the most effective antipsychotic drug for the management\nof treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but underutilised due to concerns over\nits side effects. Material and Methods: We used data from de-identified EHRs of\nthree mental health trusts in the UK (>50 million documents, over 500,000\npatients, 2835 of which were prescribed Clozapine). We explored the prevalence\nof 33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission\ntype three months before and after the patients started Clozapine treatment. We\ncompared the prevalence of adverse effects with those reported in the Side\nEffects Resource (SIDER) where possible. Results: Sedation, fatigue, agitation,\ndizziness, hypersalivation, weight gain, tachycardia, headache, constipation\nand confusion were amongst the highest recorded Clozapine adverse effect in the\nthree months following the start of treatment. Higher percentages of all\nadverse effects were found in the first month of Clozapine therapy. Using a\nsignificance level of (p< 0.05) out chi-square tests show a significant\nassociation between most of the ADRs in smoking status and hospital admissions\nand some in gender and age groups. Further, the data was combined from three\ntrusts, and chi-square tests were applied to estimate the average effect of\nADRs in each monthly interval. Conclusion: A better understanding of how the\ndrug works in the real world can complement clinical trials and precision\nmedicine.",

    "summary": "Long COVID is a general term of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Patients\nwith long COVID can endure long-lasting symptoms including fatigue, headache,\ndyspnea and anosmia, etc. Identifying the cohorts with severe long-term\ncomplications in COVID-19 could benefit the treatment planning and resource\narrangement. However, due to the heterogeneous phenotype presented in long\nCOVID patients, it is difficult to predict their outcomes from their\nlongitudinal data. In this study, we proposed a spatiotemporal attention\nmechanism to weigh feature importance jointly from the temporal dimension and\nfeature space. Considering that medical examinations can have interchangeable\norders in adjacent time points, we restricted the learning of short-term\ndependency with a Local-LSTM and the learning of long-term dependency with the\njoint spatiotemporal attention. We also compared the proposed method with\nseveral state-of-the-art methods and a method in clinical practice. The methods\nare evaluated on a hard-to-acquire clinical dataset of patients with long\nCOVID. Experimental results show the Local-LSTM with joint spatiotemporal\nattention outperformed related methods in outcome prediction. The proposed\nmethod provides a clinical tool for the severity assessment of long COVID.",

    "summary": "Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global\nhealth challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide\nand creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional\nantidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their\nlimitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and\ntreatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted\nresearchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic\napproaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich\nheritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable\nresource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some\nof these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language\nmodels with African natural products for depression support, combining\ntraditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create\naccessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.\n  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African\nmedicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their\npharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system\nthat leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system\nprovides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their\nclinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while\nmaintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings\ndemonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between\ntraditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally\nappropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and\ncontemporary medical understanding.",

    "summary": "Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are the gold standard for evaluation of\nthe efficacy and safety of investigational interventions. If every patient in\nan RCT were to adhere to the randomized treatment, one could simply analyze the\ncomplete data to infer the treatment effect. However, intercurrent events\n(ICEs) including the use of concomitant medication for unsatisfactory efficacy,\ntreatment discontinuation due to adverse events, or lack of efficacy, may lead\nto interventions that deviate from the original treatment assignment.\nTherefore, defining the appropriate estimand (the appropriate parameter to be\nestimated) based on the primary objective of the study is critical prior to\ndetermining the statistical analysis method and analyzing the data. The\nInternational Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E9 (R1), published on November\n20, 2019, provided 5 strategies to define the estimand: treatment policy,\nhypothetical, composite variable, while on treatment and principal stratum. In\nthis article, we propose an estimand using a mix of strategies in handling\nICEs. This estimand is an average of the null treatment difference for those\nwith ICEs potentially related to safety and the treatment difference for the\nother patients if they would complete the assigned treatments. Two examples\nfrom clinical trials evaluating anti-diabetes treatments are provided to\nillustrate the estimation of this proposed estimand and to compare it with the\nestimates for estimands using hypothetical and treatment policy strategies in\nhandling ICEs.",
